# Homework 6

## Course Information

- **Course Name:** CSC 101
- **Instructor:** Vanessa Rivera
- **Term:** 2023-24 Winter Quarter

## Overview

This assignment is an extension of the `Creature` class and functionality you implemented in Homework 5.
Here, you will write a program that reads custom **script** files to interact with a database (list) of `Creature` objects.
In professional programming environments, automating tasks through scripts and efficiently managing data are common practices.
This assignment is designed to give you a taste of such real-world scenarios.
For example, your program might be used to quickly assess the statistics of the `Creatures` to inform game balance design decisions.

## Learning Objectives

In completing this assessment, you will be able to:

- Write a complex program that produces non-trivial input/output functions.
- Synthesize a program from multiple distinct parts: a class, file handling, lists, and functions.
- Utilize command-line arguments to change the functionality of a program.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Copy Homework 5 Files

- **Description:** Copy and paste your completed Homework 5 `Creature` class into Homework 6's `creature.py`.
  It is highly recommended, but not strictly required, to copy your Homework 5 functions into Homework 6's `functions.py`.
  A completed `Creature` class is required for the program you will be writing.
- **Requirements:**
  - The `Creature` class must be fully implemented.
  - (Optional) Your Homework 6 functions may be copied and pasted into `functions.py`.
    - Do not erase the `list_to_creature()`, `report_creature()`, or `load_creatures_text_file()` functions included in Homework 6.

### Task 2: Write the Creature File Reading Function

- **Description:** Write a function called `load_creatures_text_file(file_path: str) -> list[Creature]`.
  This function will accept a path to a file as a single string and output a list of `Creature` objects.
  his function is intended to read files of the same format as the included `creatures.txt` file.
  Each non-blank line in this file contains information to create a single `Creature` object.
  Your function should create an empty list, open the specified file for writing, iterate on each line, and pass a relevant list of strings (use the `split()` method) to the included `list_to_creature()` function to produce a `Creature` object, and finally return a list of all such objects.
- **Requirements:**
  - Your function should produce a single `Creature` object for each non-blank line in the input file.
  - Your function must return a list of `Creature` objects.
  - Your function must ignore blank lines in a file.
  - You may, but are not required, to handle situations where the file doesn't exist.

### Task 3: Complete the Script Reading Program

- **Description:** Finish `program.py`.
  This program will treat a list as a database of creatures.
  Your program will read script files, like those within the `scripts` directory, and perform a series of operations on the database list.
  Comments within the file provide a guide and starting point.
- **Requirements:**
  - Your program must obtain a file path from the user, as given in the file 
  - Your program must read through all lines in the specified script file, ignoring any blank lines.
  - Your program must perform each operation specified in the script file.
    - Each operation is described below in the "Additional Notes" section.
  - Operations that change the database list should be cumulative, do not reload the list for each operation.
  - Your program should load the database using the `cscreatures.txt` file.
  - Your program should produce the expected output for each included script file.

### Bonus Points

## Additional Notes

### Operations

Your program will accept a file path to a script file from the user and then iterate through the lines in the file.
Non-blank lines in this file each contain an "operation" for your program to carry out.
These operations have specific behaviors that typically involve calling a function.

Some operations utilize and are followed by parameters.
The values of parameters are separated by colons (":") and the types are indicated by either "INT" (for integer) or "STR" (for string).
You will need to process each line of text to extract these parameters, converting the text into the appropriate type if necessary.
Be sure to appropriately handle or remove any unneeded whitespace as you read the script text file.
**You may do so using the `split()` and `strip()` string methods.**

As an example, the following line of text could represent an operation in one of the script files:

```
filter-by-attr-gt:resilience:30
```

This line is referring to the `filter-by-attr-gt` operation.
It has two parameters `resilience` which is a string and `30` which is an integer.
As described below, when your program carries out this function, it will reassign the database list to the same list except all creatures with a `resilience` attribute of 30 or less are removed.

The behavior of the specific operations you must handle in your program are as follows:
- `load`: This operation will reassign the database list to a new list containing all creatures from the `cscreatures.txt` text file. 
  You must use the  `load_creatures_text_file` function defined in week one.
  This operation will print the text:
  
  ```Loaded X entries```
  
  Where "X" is the size of the resulting list.
- `report-creatures`: This operation will iterate through each creature in the database list and pass it the `report_creature` function.
- `report-count`: This operation will print the following text:
  
  ```X entries```
  
  Where "X" is the size (`len()`) of the database list.
- `report-avg-exp`: This operation will print the following text:
  
  ```Experience Average: X```
  
  Where "X" is the sum total of each creature's attributes (resilience, courage, willpower, and determination) in the database list divided by the number of creatures.
  If the database list is empty, "X" should be a (floating-point) zero.
  You are recommended to use your `get_total_experience()` function from Homework 5.
- `report-avg-attr:STR`: This operation will print the following text:
  
  ```STR Average: X```
  
  Where "STR" is the given string that represents a `Creature` objectâ€™s attribute ("resilience", etc.) and "X" is the average value of that attribute among **all** creatures in the database list.
  If the given "STR" is not an attribute of the `Creature` class, "X" will be a (floating point) zero.
  You are recommended to use the `get_attribute()` function from Homework 5. 
- `report-percent-by-kind:STR`: This operation will print the following text:
  
  ```X% STR```
  
  Where "X" is the percent of creatures in the database list that have the given string in their list of `kinds` and "STR" is the given string.
  You are recommended to use the `has_kind()` function from Homework 5.
- `filter-by-kind:STR`: This operation will reassign the database list to a new list containing only `Creature` objects from the current database list that have the given string in their list of `kinds`.
  This operation will also print the following text:
  
  ```Filtered to X entries```

  Where "X" is the size of the resulting list.
  You are recommended to use the `filter_by_kind()` function from Homework 5.
- `filter-by-attr-lt:STR:INT`: This operation will reassign the database list to a new list containing only `Creature` objects from the current database list with an attribute value corresponding to the given by the string "STR" strictly less than the integer given by "INT".
  This operation will also print the following text:
  
  ```Filtered to X entries```
  
  Where "X" is the size of the resulting list.
  If the given "STR" is not an attribute of the `Creature` class, assume the attribute value is 0 for comparing to "INT".
  You are recommended to use the `filter_by_attribute_less_than()` function from Homework 5.
- `filter-by-attr-gt:STR:INT`: This operation will reassign the database list to a new list containing only `Creature` objects from the current database list with an attribute value corresponding to the given by the string "STR" strictly greater than the integer given by "INT".
  This operation will also print the following text:
  
  ```Filtered to X entries```
  
  Where "X" is the size of the resulting list.
  If the given "STR" is not an attribute of the `Creature` class, assume the attribute value is 0 for comparing to "INT".
  You are recommended to use the `filter_by_attribute_greater_than()` function from Homework 5.

### Included Scripts and Outputs

Included in the project directory is a `scripts` folder containing several scripts your program should be capable of running.
Each script contains a series of operations to perform using the creature database.
Your program will ask for the file path to one of these scripts to read upon execution.
